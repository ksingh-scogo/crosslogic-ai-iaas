    ## Multi-Tenant AI Infrastructure Platform

    CrossLogic AI IaaS provides a comprehensive platform for deploying and managing AI models at scale.
    The API is organized into two distinct groups:

    ### Platform Admin APIs
    Platform administrators use these APIs to manage the infrastructure, deploy models, and oversee tenants.
    All admin endpoints require X-Admin-Token authentication and are prefixed with `/admin/`.

    **Key Responsibilities:**
    - Upload and manage AI models
    - Launch and terminate GPU nodes
    - Deploy models to vLLM inference servers
    - Configure load balancing and routing
    - Create and manage tenant accounts
    - Monitor platform-wide metrics

    ### Tenant (Customer) APIs
    Tenants use these APIs to access inference endpoints and manage their usage.
    All tenant endpoints require Bearer API key authentication and are prefixed with `/v1/`.

    **Key Capabilities:**
    - Discover available inference endpoints
    - Perform inference (chat, completions, embeddings)
    - Manage API keys
    - View usage and billing metrics

    ## Deployment Lifecycle

    1. **Model Upload**: Admin uploads model weights to R2 storage
    2. **Model Registration**: Admin adds model metadata via POST /admin/models
    3. **Node Launch**: Admin provisions GPU nodes via POST /admin/nodes/launch
    4. **Model Deployment**: Admin deploys model to vLLM via POST /admin/deployments
    5. **Endpoint Creation**: System automatically creates load-balanced inference endpoint
    6. **Tenant Discovery**: Tenants discover endpoints via GET /v1/endpoints
    7. **Inference**: Tenants use endpoints via POST /v1/chat/completions

    ## Load Balancing

    When multiple nodes run the same model, they are automatically grouped behind a single
    inference endpoint with intelligent load balancing:
    - Health checking and automatic failover
    - Multiple strategies: round-robin, least-latency, least-connections
    - Request characteristic-based routing
    - Zero-downtime deployments

    ## Multi-Tenancy

    Tenants have isolated:
    - API keys and authentication
    - Usage tracking and billing
    - Rate limits based on tier

    But share the same model deployments for cost efficiency.

        **Platform Admin Only**

        Registers a new AI model in the platform catalog. Model weights should already
        be uploaded to R2 storage before calling this endpoint.

        **Prerequisites:**
        1. Upload model weights to R2 storage
        2. Verify model format and compatibility
        3. Determine VRAM requirements

        After registration, the model can be deployed to GPU nodes.

      summary: Launch GPU node with specified model
      description: |
        **Platform Admin Only**

        Launches a new GPU node using SkyPilot orchestrator with the specified model.
        This is the primary API for adding capacity to the platform.

        **Process:**
        1. Validates model exists in catalog
        2. Provisions GPU instance via SkyPilot
        3. Installs dependencies and vLLM
        4. Downloads model from R2 storage
        5. Starts vLLM inference server
        6. Registers node with control plane

        **Time:** Typically takes 3-5 minutes for spot instances, 2-3 minutes for on-demand.

        Returns a job_id for tracking progress via GET /admin/nodes/launch-status.

      description: |
        **Platform Admin Only**

        Terminates a GPU node and cleans up cloud resources. Uses SkyPilot for graceful shutdown.

        **Process:**
        1. Marks node as draining (stops accepting new requests)
        2. Waits for in-flight requests to complete (up to 30 seconds)
        3. Shuts down vLLM server
        4. Terminates cloud instance
        5. Removes node from load balancer rotation

        **Warning:** This action cannot be undone. Ensure no critical workloads are running.

        **This is a higher-level API that combines:**
        1. Node launching (POST /admin/nodes/launch)
        2. Model deployment to vLLM
        3. Endpoint creation and routing configuration

        Use this for production deployments. Use POST /admin/nodes/launch for more

        Removes a deployment by terminating all associated nodes and removing
        the inference endpoint from the load balancer.

        **Warning:** This will immediately stop all inference traffic for this model.
        Ensure tenants are notified before removing production deployments.

        **Platform Admin Only**

        Scales a deployment by adding or removing nodes. Scaling is performed gradually
        to maintain service availability.

        **Scaling Up:** New nodes are launched, warmed up, and added to load balancer rotation.

        **Scaling Down:** Nodes are drained (stop accepting new requests), wait for
        in-flight requests to complete, then terminated.
